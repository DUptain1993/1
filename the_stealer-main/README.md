    chrome: true
    edge: true
    firefox: false
    
  system:
    processes: true
    network: true
    files: true
```

### API Usage

```python
from stealer_api import StealerClient

client = StealerClient(api_key="your_api_key")
result = client.extract_data(target="system_info")
print(result)
```

## 🛠️ Development & Customization

### Adding New Extractors

```python
from core.extraction.base import BaseExtractor

class CustomExtractor(BaseExtractor):
    def extract(self, target):
        # Implementation here
        return extracted_data
```

### Creating Custom Encryption

```python
from core.encryption.base import BaseEncryption

class CustomEncryption(BaseEncryption):
    def encrypt(self, data, key):
        # Custom encryption logic
        return encrypted_data
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**: Run as administrator
2. **Import Errors**: Check Python version and dependencies
3. **Network Issues**: Verify firewall settings
